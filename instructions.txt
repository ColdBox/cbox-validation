INSTRUCTIONS
********************************************************************************
Just drop into your modules folder or use the box-cli to install

box install validation

The module will register several objects into WireBox using the @validation namespace.
The validation manager is registered as ValidationManager@validation

The module will also register two methods in your handlers/interceptors/layouts/views

validateModel()
getValidationManager()

You can register shared constraints in the ModuleConfig.cfc by using the settings struct

<pre>
// Validation Settings
settings = {
	// Change if overriding
	manager = "cbvalidation.model.ValidationManager",
	// Setup shared constraints below
	sharedConstraints = {
		name = {
			// field = { constraints here }
		}
	}
};
</pre>

IMPORTANT:
Please note that if you use the UniqueValidator, you will need to have the cborm module installed
in order for it to work as it relies on it.

box install cborm
